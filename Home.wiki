= Warning - Incomplete = 

We are currently experimenting with porting some of our documentation to our BitBucket wiki in order to make it easier to maintain.  Please see the [[http://www.dotnetrdf.org?content.asp?pageID=dotNetRDF%20API|main documentation]] for the time being.

= Introduction =

To get started with using dotNetRDF check out the [[User Guide]] which contains a series of step by step articles explaining how to use the Library.  If you are an advanced user who wants to leverage one of the extension points in our API please see the [[Developer Guide]]

== Important Links ==

* [[FAQs]] - Questions we get asked frequently about the library
* [[User Guide]] - Step by step articles on performing common tasks with dotNetRDF
* [[Developer Guide]] - Advanced topics for advanced users and extension developers

=== Note ===

Unless otherwise stated the documentation in the [[User Guide]] and [[Developer Guide]] refers to the latest version of the library.  Documentation for older versions can be accessed below:

* No previous versions currently available

Please note there may be a small window after a new release while we update our documentation when some pages may be inaccurate, if you find any inaccuracies please [[Contact Us]] so we can resolve them ASAP.

== Formal Documentation ==

We also provide MSDN style documentation generated from the XML comments in the code (which means our code has full Intellisense support) by going to the [[http://www.dotnetrdf.org/api/|Intellisense API]] page.
