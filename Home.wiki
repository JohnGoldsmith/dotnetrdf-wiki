= Warning - Incomplete = 

We are currently porting our documentation to our BitBucket wiki to make it easier to maintain, many links here are currently broken.

Please see the [[http://www.dotnetrdf.org?content.asp?pageID=dotNetRDF%20API|main documentation]] for the time being.

= dotNetRDF Documentation =

This wiki serves as the primary source of documentation for users and developers and is divided into several main sections:

* The [[User Guide]] covers general usage of the library including step by step introductory tutorials.  This should be the starting point for most users.
* The [[Developer Guide]] covers architectural discussions, coding standards and extensibility documentation.  This is intended for advanced users and project developers.

== Important Links ==

* [[FAQs]] - Questions we get asked frequently about the library
* [[How To]] - Quick snippets and examples
* [[User Guide]] - Step by step articles on performing common tasks with dotNetRDF
* [[Developer Guide]] - Advanced topics for advanced users and extension developers

=== Note ===

Unless otherwise stated the documentation in the [[User Guide]] and [[Developer Guide]] refers to the latest version of the library.  Documentation for older versions can be accessed below:

* No previous versions currently available

Please note there may be a small window after a new release while we update our documentation when some pages may be inaccurate, if you find any inaccuracies please [[Contact Us]] so we can resolve them ASAP.

== API Documentation ==

We also provide MSDN style API documentation generated from the XML comments in the code (which means our code has full Intellisense support) by going to the [[http://www.dotnetrdf.org/api/|Intellisense API]] page.
