= rdfQuery =

A command line utility for querying local/remote RDF using SPARQL

== Download ==

You can download this tool as part of our [[http://www.dotnetrdf.org?content.asp?pageID=Download%20dotNetRDF%20Toolkit%20for%20Windows|Toolkit]]

== Documentation ==

Command usage is as follows:

rdfQuery input1 [input2 [input3 [...]]] [options] query

e.g. rdfQuery data.rdf "SELECT * WHERE {?s a ?type}"
e.g. rdfQuery -uri:http://example.org/something -outformat:json "SELECT * WHERE {?s a ?type}" > results.json
e.g. rdfQuery -endpoint:http://dbpedia.org/sparql -out:results.srx -outformat:srx "SELECT * WHERE {?s a ?type} LIMIT 50"
As in the above examples you can query a mixture of local files and URIs by prefixing URIs with -uri:
To query a remote endpoint you can use the -endpoint: option and specify the endpoint URI. If you use this option you cannot specify any other inputs

Notes

rdfQuery uses the SPARQL XML Results & NTriples Writers as its default writers if a specific format is not specified with the -outformat option
rdfQuery writes to stdout if no output file is specified with the -out or -output option
rdfQuery reads a query from stdin if the last argument is not a query (i.e. it is anything other than some -option)
Supported Options

partialResults[:(true|false)]

Specifies whether partial results should be returned in the event of a query timeout. Only valid for queries over local files and URIs
-r:(skos|rdfs)

Applies a SKOS/RDFS reasoner to the input data. SKOS Concept Hierarchy/RDFS class & property hierarchies are dynamically determined based on the input data. You may need to reorder the input files and URIs in order to get correct inference results e.g. if your schema was the last input it would result in little/no inferences being made
-roqet

Runs rdfQuery in roqet compatibility mode, type rdfQuery -roqet -h for more information. Must be the first argument or ignored.
-syntax[:(1|1.0|1.1|E)]

Specifies what Query Syntax should be permitted
1 - SPARQL 1.0 Standard
1.0 - SPARQL 1.0 Standard
1.1 - SPARQL 1.1 Standard (Current Working Draft)
E - SPARQL 1.1 with Extensions (LET and additional aggregates)
-timeout:i

Specifies the Query Timeout in milliseconds
