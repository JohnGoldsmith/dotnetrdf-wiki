= rdfConvert =

rdfConvert is a command line utility for converting RDF between different formats.

Download

You can download this tool which is part of our Tools package by going to Download dotNetRDF Toolkit for Windows
Note for Users upgrading to 0.2.0

There are significant differences in the syntax between the version of rdfConvert in earlier versions of the toolkit and the latest releases. These were made to make it simpler to convert data and to improve the speed of conversion. Note that -rapper compatability mode was unaffected by this.

Documentation

Command usage is as follows:

rdfConvert input1 [input2 [input3 [...]]] (-out:filename.ext | -outformat:mime/type) [options]

e.g. rdfConvert input.rdf -out:output.ttl
e.g. rdfConvert input1.rdf input2.ttl input3.n3 -format:text/html
e.g. rdfConvert input.rdf -ext:n3
You can use URIs as input just by stating URIs (anything with a :// in it will be assumed to be a URI) e.g. rdfConvert http://example.org/something -out:something.rdf

Notes

rdfConvert may be used to convert between Dataset (NQuads, TriG etc) formats as well as Graph formats

Supported Options

-best

Causes the utility to attempt the best conversion it can (i.e. most compressed syntax) taking into account other options like compression level. May cause conversions to be slower and require more memory
c[:integer]

Sets the Compression Level used by compressing writers, if specified without an integer parameter then defaults to default compression. Specify -best to ensure the setting is respected
-debug

Prints more detailed error messages if errors occur
-ext:ext

Overrides the default file extension which will be automatically determined based on the -out/-format option. Must occur after the -out/-format option or it may be ignored
-format:(mime/type|ext)

Specifies an output format in terms of a MIME Type or a file extension, if the MIME type/file extension does not correspond to a supported RDF Graph/Dataset format then the utility aborts.
-help

Prints this usage summary if it is the only argument, otherwise ignored
-hs[:(true|false)]

Enables/Disables High Speed write mode, if specified without a boolean parameter then defaults to enabled
-nobom

Specifies that no BOM should be used for UTF-8 Output
-nocache

Specifies that caching of input URIs is disabled i.e. forces the RDF to be retrieved directly from the URI bypassing any locally cached copy
-out:filename.ext

-output:filename.ext

Specifies a specific file to output to (assuming only 1 input), if more than one input is specified then this parameter sets the base filename for outputs (extension ignored in this case)
-overwrite

Specifies that the utility can overwrite existing files
-pp[:(true|false)]

Enables/Disables Pretty Printing, if specified without a boolean parameter then defaults to enabled
-rapper

Runs rdfConvert in rapper compatibility mode, type rdfConvert -rapper -h for further information. Must be the first argument or ignored
-warnings

Shows Warning Messages output by Parsers and Serializers
