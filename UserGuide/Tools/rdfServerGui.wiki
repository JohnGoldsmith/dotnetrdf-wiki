As can be seen it provides three tabs:

* Create Server - Used to create a server using simple options
* Create Server Advanced - Used to create a server by providing command line options for rdfServer
* Running Servers - Used to monitor active servers

=== Create Server ===

The Create Server tab provides the easiest way to get a server up and running, fill out the options you are interested in and hit Create.  The following is a summary of the options:

|= Option |= Default |= Description |
| Host | localhost | The hostname on which the server will listen for HTTP requests. |
| Port | 1986 | The port on which the server will listen for HTTP requests. |
| Configuration File | None | Used to specify a RDF configuration file that will be used to configure rdfServer |
| Enable Log File? | Disabled | If enabled will log HTTP requests to the file specified by the Log File option |
| Log File | log.txt | Log file to log HTTP requests to, only used if Enable Log File? is enabled |

| Enable Verbose Mode | Enabled | If set additional output will be printed to the Console for monitoring. |
| Enable Quiet Mode | Disabled | If set disables verbose mode if set and reduces console output level. |
| Run as External Process | Disabled | Allows for the server to persist as a separate process beyond the life of the GUI, external processes have more limited management options. |
| Start Server Automatically? | Disabled | If enabled the server will be started as soon as you hit the Create button. |
