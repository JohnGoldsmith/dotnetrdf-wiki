= Dydra =

The [[http://dydra.com|Dydra]] cloud RDF database can be used via the [[http://www.dotnetrdf.org/api/index.asp?Topic=VDS.RDF.Storage.DydraConnector|DydraConnector]].

**Obsolete** - The ##DydraConnector## is marked as obsolete in 1.0.0 because the Dydra API has repeatedly and consistently exhibited transient failures and errors.  As of 1.0.1 there is no longer any Dydra support in dotNetRDF.

== Supported Capabilities ==

* Load, Save, Update, Delete and List Graphs
* SPARQL Query and Update

== Creating a Connection ==

Connecting to Dydra requires at least an account ID and repository ID, if the repository is not publicly accessible then a Dydra API key will also be required.

{{{
#!csharp

DydraConnector dydra = new DydraConnector("account", "repository", "api-key");
}}}

You may optionally supply a proxy server if necessary.
