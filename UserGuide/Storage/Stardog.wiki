= Stardog =

[[http://stardog.com|Stardog]] the RDF database from Clark & Parsia can be connected to via the [[http://www.dotnetrdf.org/api/index.asp?Topic=VDS.RDF.Storage.StardogConnector|StardogConnector]].  This connector uses the Stardog HTTP interface so requires a running Stardog HTTP server.

The ##StardogConnector## assumes the latest version of Stardog is being used, currently these are the 2.x releases.  A [[http://www.dotnetrdf.org/api/index.asp?Topic=VDS.RDF.Storage.StardogV1Connector|StardogV1Connector]] and [[http://www.dotnetrdf.org/api/index.asp?Topic=VDS.RDF.Storage.StardogV2Connector|StardogV2Connector]] are provided if you wish to be explicit about the version of Stardog you are connecting to.  In terms of backwards compatibility the ##StardogV2Connector## can talk to a Stardog 1.x server but we can't guarantee this will work correctly, also as we update the ##StardogV2Connector## with support for newer Stardog features these will not work if used against a Stardog 1.x server.

== Supported Capabilities ==

* Load, Save, Delete, Update and List Graphs
* SPARQL Query with configurable reasoning levels
* Transactions

== Creating a Connection ==

Connecting to a Stardog database requires knowing the Base URI for the server, a database ID and user credentials if security is enabled e.g.

{{{
#!csharp

StardogConnector stardog = new StardogConnector("http://localhost:5820", "example", "username", "password");
}}}

== Configurable Query Reasoning ==

Stardog supports configurable reasoning levels on a per-query basis.  The current reasoning level is controlled by the //Reasoning// property and takes a value from the [[http://www.dotnetrdf.org/api/index.asp?Topic=VDS.RDF.Storage.StardogReasoningMode|StardogReasoningMode]] enum.

This may be changed any time you like and affects any subsequent queries made via the //Query()// method.

== Transactions ==

Stardog is one of the few stores currently supported that support transactions, see the [[UserGuide/Storage/Transactions|Transactions API]] page for an overview of those APIs.  If the Transaction APIs are not explicitly used each operation occurs in its own transaction which is auto-committed at the end of its operation.

= Managing a Server =

We support managing a server via the [[http://www.dotnetrdf.org/api/index.asp?Topic=VDS.RDF.Storage.Management.StardogServer|StardogServer]] class which implements our [[UserGuide/Storage/Servers|Servers API]]

The ##StardogServer## assumes the latest version of Stardog is being used, currently these are the 2.x releases.  A [[http://www.dotnetrdf.org/api/index.asp?Topic=VDS.RDF.Storage.Management.StardogV1Server|StardogV1Server]] and [[http://www.dotnetrdf.org/api/index.asp?Topic=VDS.RDF.Storage.Management.StardogV2Server|StardogV2Server]] are provided if you wish to be explicit about the version of Stardog you are connecting to.

Managing a server allows you to manage a single catalog at a time, a ##StardogConnector## provides access to its associated server via the //ParentServer// or //AsyncParentServer// property.

== Connecting to a Server ==

You can also create connect directly to a server by creating an instance of the [[http://www.dotnetrdf.org/api/index.asp?Topic=VDS.RDF.Storage.Management.StardogServer|StardogServer]] class.  This requires you to know the Base URI of the server:

{{{
#!csharp

StardogServer server = new StardogServer("http://localhost:5822", "username", "password");
}}}

== Creating Stores ==

When creating a store the ##StardogServer## will provide templates from the following selection:

|= Template |= Description |
| [[http://www.dotnetrdf.org/api/index.asp?Topic=VDS.RDF.Storage.Management.Provisioning.Stardog.StardogDiskTemplate|StardogDiskTemplate]] | Used to create a Stardog disk store |
| [[http://www.dotnetrdf.org/api/index.asp?Topic=VDS.RDF.Storage.Management.Provisioning.Stardog.StardogMemTemplate|StardogMemTemplate]] | Used to create a Stardog memory store |

Both of these derive from the [[http://www.dotnetrdf.org/api/index.asp?Topic=VDS.RDF.Storage.Management.Provisioning.Stardog.BaseStardogTemplate|BaseStardogTemplate]] which provides a large range of properties that can be used to configure Stardog database options.
