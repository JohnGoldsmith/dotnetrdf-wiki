= Sesame =

We support the [[http://www.openrdf.org/doc/sesame2/system/ch08.html|Sesame 2.0 HTTP Protocol]] which allows us to communicate with any [[http://www.openrdf.org|Sesame]] based store exposed via a Sesame HTTP server.  This means we can support Sesame's own store implementations as well as others such as [[http://www.ontotext.com/owlim|OWLIM]] and [[http://www.systap.com/bigdata.htm|BigData]] which may be exposed via Sesame.

Connectivity with Sesame is done via a number of classes:

|= Provider |= Description |
| [[http://www.dotnetrdf.org/api/index.asp?Topic=VDS.RDF.Storage.SesameHttpProtocolConnector|SesameHttpProtocolConnector]] | Connect to a Sesame server that uses the latest version of the Sesame protocol |
| [[http://www.dotnetrdf.org/api/index.asp?Topic=VDS.RDF.Storage.SesameHttpProtocolVersion6Connector|SesameHttpProtocolVersion6Connector]] | Connect to a Sesame server that uses Version 6 (the current version) of the Sesame protocol |
| [[http://www.dotnetrdf.org/api/index.asp?Topic=VDS.RDF.Storage.SesameHttpProtocolVersion5Connector|SesameHttpProtocolVersion5Connector]] | Connect to a Sesame server that uses Version 5 of the Sesame protocol.  Use this if you are using an older version of Sesame prior to the addition of SPARQL Update support. |

Typically you will most likely just use the ##SesameHttpProtocolConnector## since that will always reflect the current version of the Sesame protocol.

== Supported Capabilities ==

* Load, Save, Delete, Update and List Graphs
* SPARQL Query
* SPARQL Update (if using Version 6 connector or higher)

== Creating a Connection ==

To create a connection to Sesame you need to know the Base URI of the server and the repository ID e.g.

{{{
#!csharp

SesameHttpProtocolConnector sesame = new SesameHttpProtocolConnector("http://localhost:8080/openrdf-sesame/", "example");
}}}

If you are using HTTP authentication then you can optionally supply user credentials:

{{{
#!csharp

SesameHttpProtocolConnector sesame = new SesameHttpProtocolConnector("http://localhost:8080/openrdf-sesame/", "example", "username", "password");
}}}

Additionally there are overloads for supplying a proxy server if necessary.
