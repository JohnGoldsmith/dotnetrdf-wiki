= Broken TOC =

This is a page to demonstrate that the bug with the TOC macro is not fully resolved.

I am using the macro like so:

{{{
<<toc UserGuide/Storage/>>
}}}

Which should link to all pages within that directory, however the links get extra segments added because they are calculated from the current page not the wiki root.

<<toc UserGuide/Storage/>>
