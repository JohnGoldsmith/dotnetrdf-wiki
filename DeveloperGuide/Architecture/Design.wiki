= Design =

This section of the wiki covers design documents past and present for the library.  A lot of time design for simple features/fixes takes place on the mailing list and via our [[http://www.dotnetrdf.org/tracker/|Issue Tracker]] so only major features get covered here.  In particular from 0.5.0 onwards we have heavily relied upon the issue tracker to monitor design tasks.
