= Issue Tracker Integration =

Since our recent upgrade of our [[http://www.dotnetrdf.org/tracker/|Issue Tracker]] we are now able to configure Mercurial hooks to have commits against specific issues logged on the Issue Tracker.

To configure this you will need to configure the hook as follows in your ##.hg\hgrc## file of your clone of the dotnetrdf repository:

{{{
[hooks]
outgoing.BugNet = "PATH_TO_CLONE\Build\BugNetHooks\BugNET.MercurialChangeGroupHook.exe"
}}}

The dotNetRDF repository already contains the hook to be run, you simply need to point to your local clone by replacing ##PATH_TO_CLONE## with an absolute path to your clone.  Once this is set in your ##.hg\hgrc## file the hook will be run whenever you do a ##hg push##

== Integration for hg commit ==

If you prefer to have the hook run on every ##hg commit## you can do so:

{{{
commit.BugNet = "PATH_TO_CLONE\Build\BugNetHooks\BugNET.MercurialChangeGroupHook.exe"
}}}

== Integration for hg pull ==

If you are frequently pulling in changes from other peoples repositories or those merged via the BitBucket UI using ##hg pull## you may wish to also add the following to your hooks section:

{{{
incoming.BugNet = "PATH_TO_CLONE\Build\BugNetHooks\BugNET.MercurialChangeGroupHook.exe"
}}}
