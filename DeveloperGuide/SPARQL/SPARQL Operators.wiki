= SPARQL Operators =

SPARQL Operators are an extension to SPARQL permitted by the specification which allow for implementations to extend the definition of certain operators - namely ##=##, ##!=##, ##<##, ##<=##, ##>##, ##>=##, ##+##, ##-##, ##*## and ##/##.

Currently dotNetRDF only supports extending the arithmetic operators i.e. ##+##, ##-##, ##*## and ##/##.  In the future we will likely extend this functionality to allow any operator to be overloaded.

== Extended Operators ==

Right now the only operators which dotNetRDF provides extensions for are ##+## and ##-## when used with ##xsd:dateTime##, ##xsd:duration##, ##xsd:dayTimeDuration##.  This means that when using our SPARQL engine you can add/subtract durations from date times and add/subtract durations from each other.

== Implementing Custom Operators ==

Custom operators are implemented by implementing the [[http://www.dotnetrdf.org/api/index.asp?Topic=VDS.RDF.Query.Operators.ISparqlOperator|ISparqlOperator]] interface and registering your implementation with the [[http://www.dotnetrdf.org/api/index.asp?Topic=VDS.RDF.Query.Operators.SparqlOperators|SparqlOperators]] registry.

=== The ISparqlOperator Interface ===

The ##ISparqlOperator## interface is relatively simple
