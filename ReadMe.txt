Uses code (3rd Party Libraries) from the following sources
-MySQL Connector.Net from MySQL AB http://www.mysql.org
-JSON.Net from James Newton-King http://james.newtonking.com
-Virtuoso ADO.Net Provider from OpenLink Software http://www.openlinksw.com

Thanks to the following people who have helped in the development process or whose suggestions have led to 
improvements in the code:
- Eamon Nerbonne for the BlockingStreamReader fix (http://eamon.nerbonne.org/) which is much nicer than the
  alternative of pre-caching in a MemoryStream
- Hugh Williams and Jacqui Hand of OpenLink Software (http://www.openlinksw.com) for helping me resolve some
  issues with their ADO.Net provider including promptly providing me with a fixed version once the issue
  I'd identified had been traced to it's cause and extending my evaluation license so I could build the code
- Toby Inkster (http://tobyinkster.co.uk/) for providing me with some TriX extensibility stylesheets that I 
  could use to test my TriX parser
- Marek Safar from the Mono project for fixing the bug in gmcs I identified which meant I couldn't compile
  a Mono build of dotNetRDF
- Andy Seaborne for excellent answers to various SPARQL and ARQ function library related questions which
  have contributed to the new Leviathan engine and the ARQ function library support
- The SPARQL Working Group for useful feedback and responses to my comments
