= Results Formatting =

When you make a SPARQL query as detailed on the [[User Guide/Querying with SPARQL|Querying with SPARQL]] you typically get back a [[http://www.dotnetrdf.org/api/index.asp?Topic=VDS.RDF.Query.SparqlResultSet|SparqlResultSet]] object.  While you can trivially dump results to strings using the //ToString()// method this doesn't give you a particularly pretty output, this page details various methods by which you can format results for display.

== Using Formatters ==

dotNetRDF supports a powerful [[Formatting API]] which is discussed in general elsewhere, this can be leveraged for the purposes of formatting results.  Since values in each column of a [[http://www.dotnetrdf.org/api/index.asp?Topic=VDS.RDF.Query.SparqlResult|SparqlResult]] are just normal [[http://www.dotnetrdf.org/api/index.asp?Topic=VDS.RDF.INode|INode]] values you can use any of the existing [[http://www.dotnetrdf.org/api/index.asp?Topic=VDS.RDF.Writing.Formatting.INodeFormatter|INodeFormatter]] implementations for this.

For example:

{{{
#!csharp

//Assume we already have our query results in the variable results

//Create a formatter
INodeFormatter formatter = new TurtleFormatter();

foreach (SparqlResult result in results)
{

}
}}}
